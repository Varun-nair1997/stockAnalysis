1) Modify the Keras code
      a) Understand the need for timesteps and write your own timesteps function - 2 hours
      b) Move everything to a Python file - 1 hour
      c) Re-create Python notebook systematically - 30 mins

2) Make a list of all the things I can change - Might involve learning more about LSTM and backprops - 4 hours

3) Re-train model after making those changes and look at accuracy metrics - 1 day

4) Set up evaluation metrics after first couple of runs - 3-4 hours

5) Use Varun's transformed inputs and outputs and see if it helps with accuracy at all - 1 day
    a) If yes, perfect
    b) If not, transform values with respect to the general stock market and try again

6) Look at other approaches and try to get ideas and insights from other github blogs and research pages to get a suitable accuracy - 1 day

7) Start decreasing the cut-off point bit by bit and change evaluation metrics for this purpose - 2-3 days

8) Maybe look at making:                                                                  - IDK
    a) ensemble models
    b) Using inputs other than prior stock data to make predictions

9) Work on cloud deployment and getting servers for suitable computations
